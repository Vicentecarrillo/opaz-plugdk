h2. WHAT'S THERE ?

Experiments aiming at providing a way to implement VST plugins (v2.4, no support for v3) using JRuby and jVSTwRapper.

Daniel (author of jVSTwRapper) and I are teaming to make it possible.

h2. MINI-ROADMAP

* (DONE) create a Rakefile able to package a Java plugin for Mac OS, Windows and Linux (equivalent to the existing Maven task in JVstWrapper)
* (DONE, see Rakefile and plugins/ddelay) ensure DDelay (jVSTwRapper sample) can be packaged this way
* (DONE, see plugins/jrubyproxy) experiment with JRuby to see how a VSTPluginAdapter instance can be created out of JRuby code, at runtime
* (ONGOING) add a JRuby-specific loader inside jVSTwRapper
** add a section value to specify ruby file to be loaded ?
** add a way to ruby code from the Jar instead ?
* (ONGOING) create a pure audio JRuby-based plugin
* create a pure midi JRuby-based plugin (ie: basic chords)
* create syntactic sugar to make the plugin creation simple
* ...

h2. NOTES

The libs and templates folders are generated using rake prepare:templates and rake prepare:libs.

Have a look at the rake file to see more about available tasks (compile, package, deploy).
